As the capstone of a semester-long game prototyping class, I took one of the most promising prototypes I had worked on and collaborated with an expanded group to develop it.

[*Color Coded*] (https://reagang.itch.io/colour-coded-a-one-button-game) is a one-button puzzle game in which the player attempts to get a ball to their destination by doing nothing other than toggling environmental objects on/off. 

Skills/Achievements:

- Ideated and prototyped core game concept in Unity using C# scripts. 
- Collaborated with partner to come up with initial concept, producing a functional prototype within a week.
- Collaborated with expanded team to continue to develop concept, producing a more fleshed-out project that expanded on the initial concept.
