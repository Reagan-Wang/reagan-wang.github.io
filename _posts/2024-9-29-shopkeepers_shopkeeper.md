As part of USC's CTIN-489 class, I collaborated with a partner to undergo the entire production process of a video game, producing and releasing the deckbuilder *Shopkeeper's Shopkeeper*, released on [Itch.io](https://monkeyplato.itch.io/shopkeepers-shopkeeper).

As the more technically-inclined partner, I did the bulk of the programming, whilst keeping the code as accessible as possible for my partner to make contributions whenever she was not busy designing the art assets. 

Skills and achievements:

- Programmed the card mechanics and main game loop to create a fully-functional game.
- Collaborated with partner on overall design of the game.
- Communicated creative direction with composers.
