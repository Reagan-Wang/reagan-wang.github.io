I am working as part of a 4 person engineering team to develop the incremental worker-management game *Glorgo's Microplastics Mine*. 

Achievements:

- Implemented worker AI using an entity-manager system to create an autonomous entity that dynamically responds to player commands.
- Implemented worker pathfinding, optimizing it so that the game remains performant even after instantiating many workers.
- Collaborating with our design team to ensure their creative designs are implemented as faithfully as possible, whilst offering our own feedback to suggest how their designs might be improved with the systems we have built.
