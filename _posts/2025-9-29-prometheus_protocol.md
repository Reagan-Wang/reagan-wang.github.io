As a personal project, I am developing Prometheus Protocol, a first-person action-platformer based on barely-controlling gravity and hurtling through space. A (incomplete) [demo](https://monkeyplato.itch.io/prometheus-protocol-demo) can be found here!

In addition to being a game developer, I am also a musician - and I decided that it would be a fun learning experience to handle music myself.
