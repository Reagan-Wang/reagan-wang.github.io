As a personal project, I am developing Prometheus Protocol, a first-person action-platformer based on barely-controlling gravity and hurtling through space. A (incomplete) [demo](https://monkeyplato.itch.io/prometheus-protocol-demo) can be found here!

Achievements:

- Prototyped gravity-switching mechanic in Unreal.
- Re-did Godot's first-person movement script to allow for the gravity switching mechanic.
- Used FMOD and Reaper to implement music and sound-effects.
- Used Blender to create simple animations.
- Designed levels to make the most out of the unique gravity-switch mechanic, whilst managing the level-design challenges this mechanic creates.

In addition to being a game developer, I am also a musician - and I decided that it would be a fun learning experience to handle music myself.
