As somebody who has been inclined towards storytelling, I found that I didn't get many opportunities to engage with that side of my interests given that my university curriculum was geared primarily towards engineering and design. The Narrative Review competition hosted by the Game Developer's Conference was a fantastic way for me to use my narrative skills. Both of my analyses and their accompanying posters are hosted on the GDC Vault](https://gdcvault.com/gamenarrativereview) but they can also be viewed [here](https://reagan-wang.github.io/gnranalyses/).
