Hi! I'm Reagan. I'm a game developer.

I have long believed that people should have a wide variety of skills and interests, and I strive to embody that ideal. It's a big part of why I chose games, as collaborative projects whose requirements blend artistry, design and problem-solving.

As a result, I am constantly seeking to learn and reinforce my skills - from programming to music, design to narrative analysis.
